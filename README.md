# portfolio

Created a portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves planning the structure, using semantic HTML tags, styling with CSS, ensuring responsiveness, adding content like projects and an About Me section, incorporating interactivity with JavaScript for smooth navigation and dynamic features, including a contact form, testing across browsers and devices, and deploying the portfolio online using hosting services like GitHub Pages.
